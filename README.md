# Supplemental Files for Beginning and Advanced Structural Equation Modeling

The repository contains Mplus input (.inp) and output (.out) files for the Beginning and Advanced Structural Equation Modeling workshops presented at ABCT in Nashville (November 2013). Additionally, where applicable data files are also available, usually as comma separated files (.csv). The files are organized by topic and are arranged in the order I present them in the trainings.
